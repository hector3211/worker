[x] - Need to fix edit button, does not work maybe use the same form as used on new jobs

[] - ability to save multiple pictures for a single job
[] - indicate how many pictures for a job example: 3/3 pages

[x] - make jobs clickable and route users to specific job page
[] - show all different picutres associated with job

[x] - page.tsx should be public to all and show completed and recently added jobs
